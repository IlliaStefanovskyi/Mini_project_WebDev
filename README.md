Assignment Detail
Screen Design
Before the coding process is started, a screen design process should be
completed. This will provide a detailed plan for development showing the overall
layout of the web site.
You are required to create a mock-up website that contains at least 3 pages
using an online mock-up generation tool (eg mockflow.com or draw.io).
Include the home page, product page and user details page for the
screen design.
The screen design should be based on the following specifications:
Note
The screen design of each page should show proof of using a mockup tool.
Screen prints of the coded website will attract a zero mark.
Home page
This page should be created using the grid layout.
It should contain a responsive menu with all navigation options, some detail
about the company, at least one image and a footer with contact details.
Products Page
The products page should provide the user with the option to purchase five
different products.
The product detail should include the following:
• product image
• short description
• price
• quantity purchased.
Use a web API to display the product image, description and price, ie use images
etc from this API.
This will require the use of JSON to access the data.
If there is no description and/or price data on the API, it is acceptable to create
your own description and/or price..
Refer to the rubric marking scheme for further details.
When the user selects ‘checkout’, it should provide detail about the total price
plus shipping costs and the overall total.

Once the user is happy to purchase and clicks the ‘confirm’ button, another page
should be displayed asking the user to enter the following shipping details:
• Name
• Address
• Contact number
• Email address.
Using jQuery validation, ensure that name and address are entered and that the
email is a valid email address.
When the user selects the ‘confirm’ button a message is displayed ‘Thank you for
your order’.
Gallery Page
Use a jQuery plugin to create a slideshow or a photo gallery that will display
images about the products.
Web Coding
Following on from the screen design, you are now required to complete the
coding process. Build the requested web site using the above pages guide.
General requirements for the site include:
• Use the project to demonstrate your knowledge of HTML5, CSS,
JavaScript and jQuery.
• The entire web site should be a responsive web site, ie it should look good
on all devices.
